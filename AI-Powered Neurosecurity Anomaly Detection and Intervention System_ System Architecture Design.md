# AI-Powered Neurosecurity Anomaly Detection and Intervention System: System Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

This document details the system architecture design for the AI-Powered Neurosecurity Anomaly Detection and Intervention System. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, addressing the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the requirements document.

## 2. Major System Components

The system will comprise several key components, each with distinct responsibilities, working in concert to achieve the overall system goals:

### 2.1. Neurodata Acquisition Module

**Responsibility:** This module is responsible for interfacing with various neurotechnology devices (BCIs, neuro-wearables) to collect raw neurodata streams in real-time. It will handle data standardization and initial preprocessing.

### 2.2. Real-time Processing and Feature Extraction Module

**Responsibility:** This module will process the raw neurodata streams, perform necessary filtering, noise reduction, and extract relevant features for anomaly detection. It will ensure low-latency processing to support real-time analysis.

### 2.3. Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE)

**Responsibility:** The core of the system, the ADE will house the AI/ML models responsible for continuously analyzing the extracted neurodata features to identify anomalous patterns. It will learn normal brain activity profiles and flag deviations indicative of cyberattacks or unauthorized access.

### 2.4. Intervention Management Module (IMM)

**Responsibility:** Upon detection of an anomaly by the ADE, the IMM will coordinate and trigger appropriate non-invasive intervention mechanisms. It will manage the selection and execution of interventions based on the nature and severity of the detected threat.

### 2.5. Privacy-Preserving Analytics (PPA) Layer

**Responsibility:** This cross-cutting layer will ensure that all neurodata processing and analysis adheres to privacy-preserving principles. It will implement techniques such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and federated learning to protect sensitive neurodata throughout its lifecycle.

### 2.6. User Interface (UI) and Alerting Module

**Responsibility:** This module will provide a user-friendly interface for users and administrators to monitor system status, view detected anomalies, manage consent settings, and receive alerts. It will support various alerting channels.

### 2.7. Ethical AI and Consent Management Module

**Responsibility:** This module will manage user consent preferences, ensure adherence to ethical AI principles, and provide transparency regarding data usage and AI decision-making. It will facilitate granular and revocable consent.

### 2.8. Secure Data Storage and Management

**Responsibility:** This component will securely store historical neurodata (for model training and auditing), system logs, and configuration data. It will ensure data integrity, availability, and access control.

### 2.9. System Orchestration and API Gateway

**Responsibility:** This module will manage the overall flow of data and control between different system components. It will expose secure APIs for external integrations and manage system-wide configurations.



## 3. Data Flow and Communication Protocols

The system's data flow is designed to ensure efficient, secure, and privacy-preserving movement of neurodata and control signals between components.

### 3.1. Neurodata Flow

1.  **Neurodata Acquisition Module to Real-time Processing and Feature Extraction Module:** Raw neurodata streams are ingested from BCI/neuro-wearable devices. This data is typically high-volume and high-velocity. Communication will utilize low-latency, high-throughput protocols such as Kafka or gRPC for efficient streaming.
2.  **Real-time Processing and Feature Extraction Module to Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE):** Processed neurodata features are streamed to the ADE. This communication also requires low latency. Protocols like gRPC or specialized message queues (e.g., ZeroMQ) can be used.
3.  **ADE to Intervention Management Module (IMM):** Upon anomaly detection, the ADE sends anomaly alerts and relevant metadata (e.g., anomaly type, confidence score, affected neurodata segment) to the IMM. This communication is critical and requires reliable, secure messaging (e.g., AMQP, secure REST API).
4.  **IMM to Neurodata Acquisition Module/Device:** The IMM sends commands to the Neurodata Acquisition Module or directly to the neuro-device to trigger interventions (e.g., data obfuscation, signal disruption). This requires secure, low-latency control channels, potentially using device-specific APIs or secure MQTT.
5.  **All Modules to Secure Data Storage and Management:** Relevant neurodata (e.g., for model retraining, auditing), system logs, and anomaly events are securely stored. This will involve secure file transfer protocols (SFTP), database connections (e.g., encrypted PostgreSQL), or object storage APIs (e.g., S3-compatible).

### 3.2. Control and Management Flow

1.  **User Interface (UI) to Ethical AI and Consent Management Module:** User consent preferences and ethical guidelines are managed through the UI and communicated to the Ethical AI and Consent Management Module via secure REST APIs.
2.  **UI to System Orchestration and API Gateway:** User and administrator interactions (e.g., system monitoring, configuration changes, manual intervention triggers) are routed through the API Gateway to the System Orchestration module, which then directs commands to relevant components.
3.  **System Orchestration to All Modules:** The System Orchestration module manages the lifecycle of other components, handles configuration updates, and monitors overall system health. Communication will be via internal service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) or secure internal APIs.

### 3.3. Privacy-Preserving Analytics (PPA) Layer Integration

The PPA Layer will be integrated at various points in the data flow:

*   **Data Ingestion:** Initial encryption or anonymization of neurodata can occur as it enters the system.
*   **Feature Extraction:** PPA techniques like differential privacy can be applied during feature computation to prevent re-identification.
*   **Model Training:** Federated learning will enable distributed training of AI models without centralizing raw neurodata. Homomorphic encryption can be used for computations on encrypted model updates or data during training.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** SMC can be used for collaborative anomaly detection across multiple data sources without revealing individual data.

## 4. Technology Stack Considerations

### 4.1. Data Streaming and Messaging

*   **Apache Kafka / Apache Pulsar:** For high-throughput, low-latency neurodata streaming and event logging.
*   **gRPC:** For efficient inter-service communication, especially for real-time feature transmission.

*   **MP-SPDZ / FHE.org:** For Secure Multi-Party Computation frameworks.

### 4.4. Data Storage

*   **NoSQL Databases (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB):** For high-volume, time-series neurodata storage.
*   **Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL):** For metadata, user profiles, consent logs, and system configurations.
*   **Object Storage (e.g., MinIO, AWS S3):** For long-term archival of raw neurodata and model checkpoints.

### 4.5. Containerization and Orchestration

*   **Docker:** For packaging system components into portable containers.
*   **Kubernetes:** For orchestrating and managing containerized applications, ensuring scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance.

### 4.6. Security
