# System Integration and Testing

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the integration and testing strategy for the AI-Powered Neurosecurity Anomaly Detection and Intervention System. The testing framework ensures that all system components work together effectively, meet performance requirements, and maintain the highest standards of safety and reliability.

## 2. Integration Architecture

### 2.1. Component Integration Strategy

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following integration points:

**Data Flow Integration:**
1. Neurodata Acquisition Module → Real-time Processing Module
2. Real-time Processing Module → Anomaly Detection Engine
3. Anomaly Detection Engine → Intervention Management Module
4. All modules → Privacy-Preserving Analytics Layer
5. All modules → Secure Data Storage

**Control Flow Integration:**
1. User Interface → Ethical AI and Consent Management Module
2. System Orchestration → All operational modules
3. Alerting Module → User Interface and external systems

### 2.2. Integration Testing Levels

**Unit Testing:** Individual component functionality
**Integration Testing:** Component interaction validation
**System Testing:** End-to-end system behavior
**Acceptance Testing:** User requirement validation
**Performance Testing:** Real-time processing capabilities
**Security Testing:** Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
